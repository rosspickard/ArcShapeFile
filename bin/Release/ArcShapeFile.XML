            Contains the Database field information and data values.  As each Field object is a representation of the database field of the DBF file format there are some restrictions on both field size (maximum of 245 characters for text as memo fields are not supported) and field names (maximum of 10 characters).

            10 charcters in length then it will be truncated before the counter is added.</remarks>

            A polygon consists of one or more rings, or parts.   A polygon may contain multiple outer rings.  The order of vertices or orientation for a ring indicates which side of the ring is the interior of the polygon.  The neighborhood to the right of an observer walking along the ring in vertex order is the neighborhood inside the polygon.  Vertices of rings defining holes in polygons are always in a counterclockwise direction.  Vertices for a single, ringed polygon are, therefore, always in a clockwise order.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The IsHole property attempts to indicate that the polygon part is a hole by comparing the minimum bounding rectangles of all parts of the current ShapeFile record.  A True value is returned if the part is contained with the bounds of any other part of the current ShapeFile record.  As a further check a line is drawn from the interior polygon part through the largest polygon part and the number of intersections counted (an odd number indicates that the part is within the larger part).  Why this method?  I have found that ShapeFiles created by some translators use parts to group distinct polygons that share the same attribute data, that is they do not conform to the idea that polygon consists of a series of outer rings.<br/>

            The figure on the left shows how parts can be used to denote distinct polygons with the same attributes, while the figure on the right shows how parts can be used to create holes in the polygon.  One thing that you should note programatically is that polygon holes <b>must be</b> Anti Clockwise.  You can force this before creating your shape with the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.SetPartDirection(System.Int32,ArcShapeFile.eDirection)">SetPartDirection</see> method for any parts in your shape.

            <remarks>
            The following is straight out of the ESRI technical description.  A sequence of parts (or rings) can describe a polygonal surface patch with holes.  The sequence typically consists of all Outer Ring, representing the outer boundary of the patch followed by a number of Inner Rings representing holes. When the individual types of rings in a collection of rings representing a polygonal patch with holes are unknown, the sequence must start with First Ring, followed by a number of Rings. A sequence of Rings not preceded by a First Ring is treated as a sequence of Outer Rings without holes.
            The following figure shows examples of all types of MultiPatch parts.<br/>

             <remarks>
             The WriteShape method does the actual writing of the ShapeFile record to disk. Until you use this command the entire Vertice and Field data are held in memory, so use it or loose it.  One thing
             to note is that after the WriteShape command is given the Vertices collection is emptied and the Values are stripped out of the Fields collection.  If you choose to discard the record before writing
             then it's a good idea to invoke the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.Vertices.Clear"/> command.

             Null Shape records are often used as placeholders and there are going to be times when you want to create an empty ShapeFile for use in another application.
             Well you are lucky 'cos when the WriteFieldDefs statement is given a Null Shape is automatically created (this record will be overwritten the first time you create a record).  Otherwise you can append a Null Shape record at anytime by issuing this command

            Any database fields that share the same names as those in your open ShapeFile will have the values copied across ... all others will be ignored.

            <remarks>
            Obviously, you would only use this method if you've modified the data in your ShapeFile record.  With this command the fun really begins. If you have deleted or added vertices to your shape record then the .SHP and .SHX files will be overwritten.   Similarly if you've modified the attribute values or characteristics then the .DBF needs to be re-writen. This isn't as scary as it sounds, but for big files this may be memory and IO intensive so may take a bit of time. As always, altering files is a risky business so backing up your ShapeFile before you play with it would be a good idea.

             Every now and again you find that you need to completely delete a record from your ShapeFile.  This is part 1 of that process.  The
             DeleteShape method changes the ShapeType of the record to that of a Null Shape and sets the delete flag at the start of the associated DBF record.  To complete the process and permanently 
             remove the record you must use the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.Pack"/> method. As we are only changing two flags with the DeleteShape method you can undo the delete by using the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.UnDeleteShape"/> method anytime prior to a Pack.

             <summary>
             Recalculates the MBR of each shape and updates the X,Y,Z and Measure Min/Max values of both the shape record and the entire file
             </summary>
            <remarks>
            If you have been doing a lot of editing to your Vertices then the minimum and maximum values of your shape record may be out of whack. This means that the maximum zoom extents of your ShapeFile will not be correctly displayed in products like ArcGIS. This method scans your ShapeFile and recalculates the minimum and maximum values for: 
            <li>X Coordinates</li> 
            <li>Y Coordinates</li> 
            <li>Z Coordinates</li> 
            <li>Measures</li> 
            <para> The min/max values for added or edited records are automatically recalculated when you invoke the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.ModifyShape"/> method.  Deleted vertices ... not.</para>

             <remarks>
             When you load in the vertices of a multi-part polygon you sometimes aren't too sure whether the vertice direction represents an inner or outer shape.  The ShapeFile format specifies that outside shapes have a clockwise vertice orientation, and a hole has an anti-clockwise orientation.
             Use this method to explicitly set the orientation of a part before you write it out.

            Can you use this method to add extra fields to an existing database table?  Sure can!  The WriteFieldDefs method takes care of both new and modified field structures in one go.
            If you're not storing any info along with your shapes then you can skip this step however it's implicitly fired on the first <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.WriteShape"/> of a newly created ShapeFile and if there are no fields defined then an integer field called SHAPE_ID is added.

Point in polygon searches ignore any records where the match is a polygon hole. Once found, it makes the found record current (moving the to the record and loading the various data necessary) and sets the <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.NoMatch"/> property to <I>False</I>.

            Quite simple really. Define your search criteria using a SQL strutured query or XY coordinate and do a <see cref="O:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.FindFirst">FindFirst</see>. The FindNext method searches through each ShapeFile record in turn to find the next record that satisfies the criteria. Once found, it makes that record current and sets the <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.NoMatch">NoMatch</see> property to False. If the FindNext methods fail to locate a match, the NoMatch property is set to True, and the current record is undefined.

A complete list of projections and datums can be found at the <see href="http://www.SpatialReference.org">Spatial Reference</see> organisation website.  I've implemented all the listed codes in the Datum and Projection pulldowns.
            The simplist way is just to parse the EPSG number (if you know it) e.g. WriteProjection(2193).

            The value returned by this object represents the total area of the ShapeFile.

For the area of each part refer to the Parts <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.Part.Area"/> property.
            This variable is a Nullable double so if you aren't reading a polygon ShapeFile the value will be null.

             <summary>
             The TestForHoles property allows you to turn on or off the ShapeFile librarys' ability to check for holes within polygons by using a point in polygon method.
             If it is set to False the digitised orientataion of the polygon will be used to determine holes.

             <value>Should the TestForHoles action be done</value>
            <remarks>
            By default the library relies on the orientation of the polygon parts to denote whether the part is a hole.  Clockwise means no, anti-clockwise means yes.
            If you suspect that the shapes delivered to you haven't followed this rule then set the TestForHoles property to True.  This will force a point in polygon test before the <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.Part.IsHole"/> property of the Parts collection is set.  The downside of this is that it slows the read speed.

             The ReadMode property allows you to turn on or off the automatic loading of ShapeFile 
             vertice and database information. Setting this to HeaderOnly can be handy when you don't

             information separately
             </summary>
             <value>How do you want the record to be read</value>
            <remarks>
            <para>Set this property before any move action to change the way the DLL loads the data.  The question really is - When to use what method.
            Let's see.  FullRead loads all the data into the Vertices and Fields collections. The upside of this is that it is easy to then manipulate all the data for the ShapeFile. The downside is that it does take time to load the data into the collections. This may be a real headache if you are reading a record with a large number of vertices.
            So ... If you're loading a ShapeFile and want to scan through to find a particular condition then HeaderOnly might be the one to use.</para>
            <para>HeaderOnly mode reads in the MBR values of the Vertices (including the how many vertices there are) but doesn't load any of the data into the collections.  This makes it fast to scan through all the records.
            When you want to see the contents of a particular record then you can load the Vertice data using the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.LoadShapeData"/> method and/or the database values into Fields using the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.LoadDBFData"/> method.</para>
            <para>If you want the best of both worlds use my personal favourite - FastRead.  This method loads all the record metadata (number of points, number of parts, the MBRs), populates the Fields collection with the database attributes, but holds all the vertice data in an internal byte array.  Everytime you read a vertice the DLL scans the array for the correct byte offset.  
            What it doesn't do is caluclate centroids, areas and test for holes.</para>
            <para>So how fast are the various methods?  Here are some results reading the vertices from a polyline shapefile with 688,354 records.

            <remarks>
            NULL shape records are often used as place holders in the ShapeFile or, in the case of this DLL, as an indicator that the current record has been marked for deletion.
            This is the only time that you can have more than one shape type within one ShapeFile.  NULL shapes take up space in the file, but their contents are skip over.  To really remove these beasties you should <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.Pack"/> the file.

            <ul>
            <li>Move to the next record before saving the changes and the vertice point won't be removed</li>
            <li>When you save the altered shape with one less vertice point in it the ShapeFile will need to be re-written.  I've tried to make this procedure as fast as possible but ...</li>
            <li>Removing vertices will automatically adjust the <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.Part.Begins">Begins</see> and <see cref="P:ArcShapeFile.Part.Ends">Ends</see> properties of the <see cref="T:ArcShapeFile.Parts">Parts</see> collection</li>
            </ul>
            Get the picture?
            The deleted <see cref="T:ArcShapeFile.Vertice">Vertice</see> becomes permanently removed from the shape when you use the <see cref="M:ArcShapeFile.ShapeFile.ModifyShape">ModifyShape</see> method.
